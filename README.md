# 3dPrinting

## Why am I doing this?

#### Two main reasons:  
1. I seems the world operates in video now. It certainly has its advantages, but it sucks to find content and to go back to that content.  
I want some place that I can read stuff, stuff that are organized in a proper structure, within the proper subjects of that particular area.  

2. I want to remember this stuff, so I can improve later on. One brick after the other.  
And I can't have another notebook, I have too many already.  

#### Two secondary reasons:  
1. I get to practice my english  
2. I get to learn a little bit of HTML.  

## What to expect?  
I don't know. I hope I can update it often.  
For now, I will work on the upgrades of my Ender 3Xs printer and record what piece of knowledge I find important.  
For a close future, I want to create:  
* a clear workflow for 3d printing regarding preventive maintanence  
* basic and periodical checks and tests
* a good and robust cost system


## Who I am?
I have a major in industry engineering, and more than 10 years of experience in the metalluergical industrial, both as an engineering, and as a financier.  
I am and industrial costs especialist, and decades ago when the 3d printer process started to get popular I got very interested, but my priorities were others.
I think this can change the world as we know it, descentralizing the production means.  
Well, better late then never. I finally decided to learn this.
