## What to do right after the assemble  


Alright, you assembled your printer AND leveled your bed (really, level that thing!) now you are ready to 3d print you first thing ever, but what should it be?  
Well, i reccomend these things, in that order:  

1. Calibration cube
2. Benchy

These things are important, because you can check if your printer is working accordingly.  


Take your time to read the description of the things, especially the benchy manual.  
Also, you will need a caliper to measure your stuff.  

So, download it, and save it on your hard drive, you will use it a lot apparently.  
3d printing is not a stable process so far, it is far from stability and easiness of the paper printers we have now, so every now and then you need to do this kind of check (on top of leveling your bed).  

The tricky part is: At this very moment, you don't know the correct parameters for the filament you have, which can change depending on the material, brand, color, room temperature, etc.  
The Ender 3 I bought came with a little bit of PLA, so I used the standard quality cura profile. 
It turned out alright, maybe not perfect, but ok.  
There was some small variations of 0,5mm in some measurents, but for the first thing ever printed by me, in a 3d printer newly assembled, I consider this a win!  

If everything is ok, go have some fun with it. Before doing anything else, I spend two days printing the cable chains and side mount for the printer.  
You don't need perfection, specialy at the very begining. Done is better than perfect.  

There are two other things that are important to print to check if your printer and material are calibrated, that is the tower temperature and the string test (aka retraction test?). But for now I think that it is enough.  

I saw a lot of people being very naggy about other people's printing in social media, especialy with outspoken beginners. Forget about them, you are still learning (and so am I), and this period is the most fun.  
Celebrate the little victories!

Measure this cube with your caliper, if you read the instructions, it should be 20mm each side.

There a lot of measurements to be done, and things to evaluate in the thing. Do it and try to fix if there is something to be fixed.
