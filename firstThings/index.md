## First things to do

Once you get your printer home, I knew that I had to assemble it.  
But should I follow the manufacturer manual, or one of the thousands youtube videos?  
After the assemble, is it ready to print?  
Can I print that cat armor project so that I can pet and hug the ultimate killing machine?  
All importante questions, but first things first:
