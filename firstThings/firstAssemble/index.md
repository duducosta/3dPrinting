## Assemble your printer

There are probably several videos teaching how to assemble your printer.  
Also, there is a manual from you manucturer.  
Maybe these two things have the same content, maybe that is a little bit different.  

For the Ender 3, I suggest using the [CHEP video](https://youtu.be/2Th2e7wTNV0).  
It is different from the manufacturer manual, but he goes through a lot of details and adds a few important checks and methods to make sure every important thing is in its correct place.  
NOTE: You will need clamps and squares.  

Follow his guide and you are probably golden.  
I used his guide, leveled my bed, and the first objects I printed were near perfect.  


There is not much alse to add, Chep knows his stuff.
