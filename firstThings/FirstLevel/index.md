## Level your bed

Ok. As far as my engineering background and tell, and a few good people on the internet, this is probably one of the most important things in 3d printing.  
Weirdly, it is also simple, but overlooked.  

There is a lot of material on that, here is the ones that i liked the most:  

1. [Teaching Tech beginner instructions](https://youtu.be/Ze36SX1xzOE)
2. [CHEP Easy way to level your bed](https://youtu.be/_EfWVUJjBdA)


### My summary of the thing is:  
#### There are two goals:  
1. Make the bed PARALLEL TO THE EXTRUTER PATH; Never leveled to the ground, or your table, or anything else.  
Your bubble level will not be of any good in here. 

2. Adjust the gap between the nozzle tip and the bed.  


### Important things to watch out:  
1.  If you bought your printer with a magnetic bed AND a glass bed. Use the magnetic one first, so you don't damage the glass one (which is expensiver).  
You can see that i did that. The first time I was leveling I forced the extruder to the right side of the printer, but it was way to close to the bed.  
Result: Permanent mark in my magnetic bed.

2. The office paper trick is good enough for now. There is no need to worry about the BLTouch, gauges, etc. Take your time, learn to use the paper, master the bed leveling.  
Aftere a while, maybe I will look into those things, but for know it is working, and costs virtualy nothing.

3. I leveled it a week ago, and did not had to level it again so far.  
The slicer prints a little "circle" around the object in the first layer. Because I spent my with this, I use this circle to see if the leveling is ok, and I make minor adjustments on the go. Remember: I have 2 weeks of experience so far.  
Use your eyes, try to figure out how it should look, and work from that.
