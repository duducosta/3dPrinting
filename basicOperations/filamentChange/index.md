## Filament change  



**-- 20/09/2020 --**  
You probably have done this already during your first assembly and testing.  
But I worried about cloging the PTFE tube, the nozzle and a lot of problems people report on the internet.  
It turns out it is not that hard.  

### Steps to get done for the Ender 3 Pro
The steps below should be similar in all filament based printers.  
  
1. Heat the nozzle at you printing temperature for thar material
2. Press the extruder handle so that you can move your filament freely
3. Push the filament forcing it AGAINST the nozzle, the same direction the material go when printing something
4. Let about 1 cm of material to come out of the nozzle
5. Quickly, and in one movement pull the filament out of the ptfe tube AND the extruder. DON'T STOP until the filament is 100% out
  
Now, here is what people generaly don't say:  
6. DonÂ´t lose traction of the filament, otherwise you will comprimise the rolling process of the spool, causing future feeding problems.
7. Fix the filament on the side of the spool with your preferred method (in my case, office adhesive tape)

  
Back to changing the filament
8. Cut the tip of the new filament in a chanfer with a sharp angle. This will make it easier to feed to into the ptfe tube

9. Press the extruder handle so that you can move your filament freely
10. Push the filament intul it touches the nozzle
11. Push the filament until ONLY the new color comes out. This will clean the rest of the old filament from the hot end and nozzle interior  
Note that the the pushed material starts as white (old filament) and fases into black (new filament)
