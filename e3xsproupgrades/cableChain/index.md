Who does not like organized cables?
This project provides a chain that fits your Ender 3 perfectly, and without the need for screws, disassemble of cables, or anything. Just print, put it together and that's it.
This was the very first useful thing that I printed (after the leveling test and the calibration cube), I even printed it with the filament that came with the printer.

I recommend not printing the quantity of links that the designer suggests, because I used less than that, and I saw some videos of people that also ended up with spare parts after the assembly.
I used 16 of the smaller ones and X of the biggers ones.

The down side is that it takes a long time to print such tiny pieces. 
I was able to put 5 of each smaller link on the bed, and used the "One at a Time" setting on Cura.
It took about 2h20m each batch of 5 units.
The bigger ones I was able to put 4 of each on the bed, and took about 1h50m each batch of 4 units.

I used the standard Quality setting on Cura + 0,15 layer height.
