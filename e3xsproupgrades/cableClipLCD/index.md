More cable organization.
This project is a simple clip that makes you LCD flat cable go around the aluminum extrusion piece of your Ender 3.
Easy print, you can probably fit 3 or more of them in one go.

I used the standard Quality setting on Cura + 0,15 layer height (I forgot to change it, but it could probably to done with higher layer).
