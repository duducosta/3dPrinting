My inner engineering felling conviced my to make this one.  
I read about it, and saw some videos about how the angle of the filament is too sharp for the extruder, and that after months of usage it even starts to cut the extruder feeding hole.  
I saw no evidence for that, but it seems to me that it is indeed a sharp angle, and a straight fed filament provides less friction.  

It took ~5h30m to print it, but the quality was ok.  

Be aware to print the correct version for your Ender 3 (V1 or V2), because they have a 6mm height diference between them.  
I printed the wrong one, but I was able to drill this 6mm from the holes; hopefully it will not compromise the structural integrity.  

I also was not able to find T nuts to buy, and tried regular nuts: It does not work. So, buy those T nuts before hand.  

Other than that, it was fine, and works like a charm!
